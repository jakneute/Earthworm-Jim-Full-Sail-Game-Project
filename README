While attending Full Sail University, one of my classes gave me 2 weeks to code a game on my own. Most of the source code was written by me but there are several DirectX wrappers that I cannot take credit for, but the comments section in those source files give credit where credit is due. The code I wrote focused mainly on core gameplay. Sure, it's a little janky, but I'm very proud of the results. Every feature I wanted to implement made the cut with the exception of a working high score table, as I ran out of time.

I preserved the results of my week 1 milestone and my week 2 milestone (final) for curiosity's sake. Feel free to mess around with either.

Please note, if you want the code to compile (in its initial state), you need to have a directX 9.0+ SDK.
